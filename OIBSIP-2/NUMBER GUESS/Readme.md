# Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java console application that allows users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It provides an interactive experience where players can enter their guesses and receive feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low.

## How to Play

1. The game generates a random number between a specified minimum and maximum value.

2. The player is prompted to enter their guess.

3. If the guess matches the generated number, the player wins the game.

4. If the guess is higher or lower than the generated number, the player is provided with a hint to adjust their next guess accordingly.

5. Steps 2-4 are repeated until the player correctly guesses the number.

6. Once the player guesses the correct number, their score is displayed, indicating the number of attempts it took to win the game.
